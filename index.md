## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/1699988867625.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Usanbolor Amartuvshin.As a passionate and hands-on mechanical engineering student at Cornell University, I thrive at the intersection of design, manufacturing, and innovation. My experience on Cornell Racing and various academic and personal projects has allowed me to apply classroom knowledge to real-world engineering challenges—from CAD modeling and prototyping to design for manufacturability and cross-functional collaboration. I’m also a member of the ZT research group, where I’m exploring the design, manufacturing, and testing of thermal interface materials—deepening my understanding of materials science and thermal systems. I’m driven by curiosity, committed to continuous learning, and excited to contribute to impactful projects that combine creativity, precision, and user-centered thinking.

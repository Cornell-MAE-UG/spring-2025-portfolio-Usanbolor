I'm part of the Cornell Racing - electrical vehicle race car our team builds, design in house from scratch. As a member of the Ergonomics subteam I'm in charge of designing and manufacturing the steering wheel. 

The steering wheel gives the driver direct control over the car, enabling them to steer left or right through its connection to the steering system and the front wheels. Without it, the car would only be capable of moving in a straight line with no directional control. An ergonomically well-designed steering wheel helps reduce arm fatigue and discomfort, which can enhance driver performance over longer periods. The integration of new buttons and dials further improves control efficiency, allowing the driver to make critical adjustments without distraction. Additionally, by targeting a lighter design, even small reductions in mass contribute positively to overall vehicle performance—lighter cars accelerate faster.


This year I have integrated new electronic components (push buttons and dials) as well as new driver grips with better ergonomic design using Autocad Freeform. To elaborate - the grips are meant to mimic the hand position that is most comfortable for each driver’s hand, that way during drive hand fatigue over a long period of time is less of a problem.In addition, during the process of designing the steering wheel, I encountered several challenges such as determining the optimal ply schedule for the carbon fiber layup, managing limited space for the integration of electronic component harnessing, and resolving discrepancies between my 3D CAD models and the physical fit of the parts. Each of these setbacks taught me to carefully evaluate constraints and trade-offs, and to make deliberate, effective design choices that results in high performance and balanced manufacturability and reliability. 

Throughout the whole process I have honed my CAD skills, composites works including working with carbon fiber, welding, machining parts, integrating electrical components.
